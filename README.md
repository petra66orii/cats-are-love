# MeowMatch

Welcome to MeowMatch! This website is aimed at people that are looking for a little fluffy best friend. Cats are known for their independent personalities and health-related benefits. They are gorgeous, little balls of fluff that need love and care. We here at MeowMatch are aiming to provide with each and every one of these little souls a forever home with their family. 

We highly encourage you to contact us, whether you're looking for a playful kitten or a wise older cat, because we believe that every cat deserves a loving and caring home. 

## Target Audience

The website is simple to use, it contains testimonies from previous clients that adopted through us, a gallery with the cats that we have in the shelter and a scetion with a form to apply for adopting a cat.
