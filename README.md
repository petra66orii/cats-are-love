# MeowMatch

Welcome to MeowMatch! This website is aimed at people that are looking for a little fluffy best friend. Cats are known for their independent personalities and health-related benefits. They are gorgeous, little balls of fluff that need love and care. We here at MeowMatch are aiming to provide with each and every one of these little souls a forever home with their family. 

We highly encourage you to contact us, whether you're looking for a playful kitten or a wise older cat, because we believe that every cat deserves a loving and caring home. 

## Target Audience

This website is targeted at people who are on the lookout for a cat to adopt, whether they are families with children, couples of any age or people that live alone and want a furry and sweet companion. The website is simple to use, it contains testimonies from previous clients that adopted through us, a gallery with the cats that we have in the shelter and a section with a form to apply for adopting a cat.

## Design

### Color Scheme

The color scheme is a fairly simple one, as the main focus should be on the cats and on the information regarding our services and potential pets. The pale pink is used on the title and social network icons in order to contrast the dark background, whereas the body of the website itself is pale pink as the website contains many images of cats; this is so the website isn't overloaded with content.
