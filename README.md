# MeowMatch

Welcome to MeowMatch! This website is aimed at people that are looking for a little fluffy best friend. Cats are known for their independent personalities and health-related benefits. They are gorgeous, little balls of fluff that need love and care. We here at MeowMatch are aiming to provide to each and every one of these little souls a forever home with their new family. 

We highly encourage you to contact us, whether you're looking for a playful kitten or a wise older cat, because we believe that every cat deserves a loving and caring home.

# Target Audience

This website is targeted at people who are on the lookout for a cat to adopt, whether they are families with children, couples of any age or people that live alone and want a furry and sweet companion. The website is simple to use, it contains testimonies from previous clients that adopted through us, a gallery with some of the cats we have in the shelter and a section with a form where the user can complete and send to the shelter.

## User Stories

* As an animal lover, I am looking for a website that can offer options to pick a forever friend, as well as guidance towards the best care I can offer to my new pet. 

* As a visitor, I am looking for a simple, yet resourceful website where I can learn more about cats. This includes a user-friendly design and a contact form in order to find out more information.

## User Goals

1. Easy and responsive website helps the customer navigate the adoption process no matter what devices they're using by using media queries and flexbox containers
2. The page is filled with useful information the customer would need before taking this important step for both them and the cats  
3. Customers can always get in touch with the shelter for further inquiries using the form in the "Contact" page

## Business Goals

1. To help households and people adopt a loving pet
2. Raise awareness on animal abandonment and encourage adopting instead of buying a pet
3. Offer mistreated or abandoned animals a second chance for a better life

# Design

## Color Scheme

The color scheme is a fairly simple one, as the main focus should be on the cats and on the information regarding our services and potential pets. The white is used on the title and social network icons in order to contrast the dark background, whereas the body of the website itself is pale pink as the website contains many images of cats; this is so the website isn't overloaded with content.

![Color scheme for the project, the colors are black, dark grey, pale pink and white](assets/images/palette.png)

## Typography

For the fonts I've chosen Lora and Vollkorn for an elegant feel to the webpage. Below there is a screenshot of both fonts:

### Lora

![font styles Lora](assets/images/lora-font.jpg)

### Vollkorn

![font styles Vollkorn](assets/images/vollkorn-font.jpg)

## Imagery

All the images were taken from pexels.com. The images are impactful in order to deliver the message about the importance of adoption and also the sad reality that comes with animal abandonment/mistreatment.

## Wireframes

I used Balsamiq to create the wireframes. These wireframes were designed before the actual construction of the website. While building the website, I would see a better way to implement information and graphics and apply those instead. The wireframes were very helpful to get an initial idea of how I'd want the webpage to look like, but have since strayed for a better user-friendly website.

# Features

## General Features

### Navigation Bar

A navigation bar is featured on all three pages for ease of use and accessibility. There are two different versions of the navbar depending on whether you're navigating the website on mobile or desktop, hence adding responsiveness to the webpage. The active page is shown by having an oval around the text.

Desktop navigation bar

Mobile navigation bar

### Footer Links

There are links to social media websites included on every page, the icons were taken from Font Awesome and I've attributed them the white color for a nice aesthetic feel.

![Footer links](assets/images/footer-links.jpg)

## Features by Page

### Home Page

The home page has the "About" section at the top of the page. The "About" section is describing the purpose of the website and encourages the user to explore the website. Scrolling down there is a small gallery of cats that are put up for adoption through the website alongside with a short description about each cats' personality, so the user can have an idea about the specific cats' behaviour. At the bottom of the page there are positive client reviews that have previously adopted through the website and were delighted with their newfound friends; this gives the user trust into the shelter.

![Our cats section screenshot](assets/images/screenshot-index-cats.png)
![Testimonials section screenshot](assets/images/screenshot-index-testimonials.png)

### Services Page

The services page contains the price list that the shelter offers in order to help the new owner assure that their new pet has all of the necessary vaccines and medical procedures done before going to their new forever home. This helps the user not consider adoption an overwhleming process by letting the shelter take over when it comes to medical procedures. Below the table there is a description about every service provided and why it's a good (and absolutely necessary) thing to do in order to have a healthy pet. At the bottom of the page there is a gallery of cats of all ages around the shelter.

![Second part of gallery section screenshot](assets/images/screenshot-services-gallery2.png)

### Contact Page

The contact page includes a simple contact form for possible clients and/or people that want to enquire about the cats that are in the shelter. All the fields are required to be completed in order for the form to be sent to the staff. There is also a "Reset" button to reset the form details. Below the contact form there is a table containing the opening hours, important information like the address, phone numbers and email address. There is also an embed map from Google Maps that pinpoints the location of the shelter. All this information helps the user find the place and can count on the staffs' availability for enquiries.

## Future Implementations

* Ideally I'd implement a donation section where people who love animals but maybe don't have the possibility to adopt can donate so the shelter can continue to provide the best care for the cats.
* A larger database containing information about the cats that are cared for at the shelter.
* A blog section where people can read about the successes and subsequent struggles that come with looking after the shelter to raise awareness.

## Accessibility

* I have used aria-labels everywhere I could for screen readers
* All images have alt-descriptions
* The HTML contains a lot of semantic elements for an easy-to-follow structure

# Testing

## Validation

![HTML validator website screenshot](assets/images/html-validator.png)

### CSS Validator
The style.css file was validated by using both the official Jigsaw and the W3C validator.

![CSS validator website screenshot](assets/images/jigsaw-css-validator.jpg)
![CSS validator W3C screenshot](assets/images/w3c-css-validator.jpg)

### Lighthouse

I used DevTools' Lighthouse on Google Chrome for the testing and I was slightly upset to see that the performance was significantly lower than expected. One of the reasons the tester was implying was that I had installed a good few Chrome extensions which are subsequently slowing down the performance, and recommended I used Incognito mode for a fairer test, but it was still very low. 

![Lighthouse performance test for the index page](assets/images/lighthouse-poor-performance.png)
![Lighthouse performance test for the services page](assets/images/lighthouse-poor-performance-services.png)

Further feedback from Lighthouse suggested that the images used within the website were very large and hence were affecting the performance. So, I've used the free **imageresizer** website to resize the images while maintaining their quality. The results were ok after that, performance-wise. 

![Lighthouse final performance](assets/images/lighthouse-final-index.png)
![Lighthouse final performance](assets/images/lighthouse-final-services.png)
![Lighthouse final performance](assets/images/lighthouse-final-contact.png)

I've received a "Best Practices" score of 78 on the contact.html page because the form didn't contain an HTTPS connection. Since this website only requires HTML & CSS code, this problem is beyond the scope of the project and subsequently will be left as such.

![Best practices score contact page](assets/images/best-practices-contact.png)

## Accessibility

When I first tested the accessibility on the webiste using Wave, I got this error. 

![Wave accessibility error](assets/images/wave-error.png)
![Wave accessibility error explanation](assets/images/wave-error-card.png)

This was because the label and input weren't used for their intended purpose. The fix was easy, though: an aria-label was applied to the `<label>` tag and the error was fixed.

## Bugs

* The first bug I've encountered was that the footer wasn't fixed to the bottom of the webpage, and a line would show under the footer. Note that since the bug was discovered and fixed early, the screenshots shown don't represent the final product. 

![Screenshot of webpage showing footer bug on mobile](assets/images/bug1-footer-mobile.png)
![Screenshot of webpage showing footer bug on desktop](assets/images/bug1-footer-desktop.png)

This was an easy fix, as I only needed to set the position to 'fixed' and set the bottom to 0.
